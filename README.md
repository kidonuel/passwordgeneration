Bash Password Generator
This Bash script generates a random, secure password with capital letters, small letters, numbers, and special characters.

**Usage**
Clone this repository to your local machine: To use the script, you first need to clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this by navigating to the repository on GitHub and clicking on the "Code" button. From there, you can copy the repository's URL and use it to clone the repository using a Git client or the git clone command in the terminal.

Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository directory: Once you have cloned the repository to your local machine, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is located using the cd command.

Run the script using the command: ./pwgen.sh To run the script, type the command ./pwgen.sh in the terminal and press enter. This will execute the script and prompt you to enter the length of the password you want to generate.

Enter the length of the password you want to generate: When prompted, enter the length of the password you want to generate and press enter. The script will then generate a password with the specified length and display it on the screen.

Note: If you get a permission denied error when trying to run the script, you may need to make the script executable by running the command chmod +x pwgen.sh in the terminal before running the script.

**Security**
This script uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator to ensure that the generated passwords are truly random and secure.

Customization
You can customize the script by changing the character sets used to generate the password. For example, you can remove the special characters or add additional character sets.
